### About The Project

This project contains the source code of our traffic routing framework, located in the ["UTC"](./UTC) folder, 
along with README files that describe the usage. For our results, we used a google drive 
[repository](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oPbev62izPYX3boJJF4yiA-D3Dwz59io/view?usp=sharing), due to their
size (~200MB). The video presentation is located in this repository and can also be view on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhC6QUyQGi8).
